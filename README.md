# Getting Started with React ChatGPT Clone

Before you start, you have to create your own OpenAI API key (free plan is available):

1. Download or clone the React ChatGPT Clone repo.

2. Visit [the OpenAI platform](https://platform.openai.com), create an account and log into it.

3. Go to the [API keys section](https://platform.openai.com/account/api-keys) and clock "Create new secret key". Don't forget to copy it as it displays (it happens only once)

3. Open your plain text editor (Notepad, Sublime Text, etc.) and put here: ```API_KEY = ``` then paste OpenAI key

4. Save the file in the React ChatGPT Clone folder

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm run start:frontend`

Runs the app's frontend in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm run start:backend`

Runs the app's server in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:8000](http://localhost:8000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
